# hello-world
My first repository

Hi, my name is Annelies!
I have never worked with GitHub before so you can say I'm a noob. Please bear with me.

I kinda know (or knew) HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Python and some Javascript. It's been a while since I've worked with those languagues, which is why I'd like to work on a (small) project again. To refresh my knowledge!
